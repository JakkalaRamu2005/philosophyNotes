The main point of this talk is that AI is "for real this time" and is already changing every major industry in ways we are just beginning to see.

The three CEOs explained three big ideas:

1. AI is Changing Movies and Art
From "Rendering" to "Generating": The CEO of Stability AI (Prem) explained that movies like Avatar used to take thousands of hours of computer time to create just one single frame.

The Big Change: With new AI, that same frame can be "generated" in just minutes.

What this means: This will cause an "explosion" of new content, maybe 10-20 times more than we have now. It will be much cheaper and faster for anyone to tell their story.

2. AI is Learning the "Language" of Life
Beyond Text and Images: The CEO of You.com (Richard) said AI is learning new "languages." The most exciting one isn't humanâ€”it's the language of proteins.

The Big Change: Proteins are the "Lego blocks" of all life. AI is getting so good that you can ask it to "create a new protein that only binds to a cancer cell" or "a protein that stops a virus."

What this means: This will completely change medicine and how we cure diseases.

3. You Don't Need Billions to Build AI
The Big Surprise: The CEO of 01.AI (Kai-Fu Lee) shared that his team built one of the world's best AI models for only $3 million.

The Big Change: Other companies (like OpenAI) spent $80-100 million to get similar results.

What this means: They had less money and fewer powerful computer chips, so "necessity became the mother of innovation." They were forced to be smarter and more efficient. This proves that powerful AI can be built by smaller teams anywhere in the world.

What Should Young People Do?
The CEOs finished by giving funny, conflicting advice for students:

CEO 1 said: "Don't learn to code. English (your natural language) is the new programming language."

CEO 2 said: "Do learn to code. It helps you understand how the magic works."

CEO 3 said: "Just follow your heart." Do what you are passionate about, whether it's coding or not.
