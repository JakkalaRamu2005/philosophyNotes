Stoicism says —
It’s not the world that defeats you,
it’s your weak desires and your inner laziness that destroy you.

So if you want to become a Stoic,
you must rise from your “mental grave.”
Because sleep is your real enemy —
only dead people sleep all the time.

A real Stoic or wise man doesn’t believe in “tomorrow.”
He conquers today.

So wake up like a lion,
walk like a king,
not like a slave who bends his back.
Stop walking with fear.
Stand straight — your backbone is strong.

Every step you take should be conscious and powerful.
Each step should increase your masculinity and testosterone.
When you step forward, imagine you’re entering a battlefield.
Don’t run — fight!
You were born to fight, not to escape.

If you run away,
a curse (or storm) will follow you.
And the moment you think you’re safe,
that same curse will destroy you.

This human society is more dangerous than a jungle.
Every step has challenges and dead souls around you.
There will be pain and joy, both.
So you must fight your own war.

Stay hungry — both physically and mentally.
Hunger and fasting make you a real man.
Fasting doesn’t just clean your body —
it also cleans your mind.

Every growl of hunger gives you new energy.
It makes you strong, disciplined, and sharp.

Modern foods are destroying us —
sugar, salt, and seed oils are poisons in disguise.
Eat real food, spend money on natural food,
because real food makes real humans.

Your body needs zinc and magnesium.
Zinc boosts your testosterone,
and magnesium repairs your nerves.
Without them,
your body becomes weak,
your mind becomes foggy,
and your focus disappears.

Stop watching porn and wasting your energy.
If you store your semen for seven days,
your energy increases by 50%.
That energy is life-creating power.
So don’t waste it cheaply —
convert it into strength,
and use it to attack life.

Every day, defeat coldness.
Take cold showers —
they tighten your nerves,
shock your system,
and increase testosterone, patience, and mental clarity.

Run every day —
it empties your mind.
A person who runs under a tree
and a monk who meditates under a tree are the same —
because running = meditation.

Go to the gym, but not just for six-pack abs.
You’re not a movie hero.
If you work out too much,
you’ll need to eat and rest more —
and that makes you lazy.

If you eat and sleep too much,
your brain won’t work properly.

So exercise more for your brain, not only your body.
This isn’t the stone age anymore —
brain is the new muscle.

Read one book every week.
Respect valuable information.
Don’t act like Einstein.
Listen carefully to others.
Stop watching reels all the time.
Today, reels rule the world,
and we have become their slaves by scrolling endlessly.

Do a digital detox — it’s very important.
Say goodbye to Swiggy and Zomato.
They don’t just increase your weight,
they increase your laziness.
Every order makes you a little more dependent and foolish.

Remember — those apps are not made for people like us,
they are made for people who truly need them or the rich.

Stop blindly believing everything.
Stop doubting your partner unnecessarily.
But learn where to doubt —
if you don’t doubt where you should,
then you’ll be the fool in the story.

Respect the people who rejected you.
Don’t act crazy or angry.
That rejection may feel like hell,
but it’s okay —
only the person who has seen hell’s depth
can understand heaven’s height.

Finally —
sleep like a dead body every night.
Die every night,
and wake up reborn the next morning.
Then you will never truly die.

🔥 In short:
This whole message means —
Wake up. Discipline your body, mind, and habits. Stop being lazy, weak, and distracted. Fight life with full strength, live consciously, and build yourself every single day.
