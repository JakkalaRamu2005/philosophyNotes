ðŸŒˆThis Is How I Lost Myself In Loving YouðŸ’”
At some point, I realized that I cared about you more than I cared about myself.


Along that same path, you stopped caring about me completely.

When we were together, I felt incredibly happy.

It seemed like we understood each other completely.

That's why I didn't mind how quickly our relationship was progressing.

We were moving forward so fast that it both scared and excited me.

Everything felt so perfect that I didn't want to slow down.

I didn't realize that we were rushing through our lives together and falling behind.

I was so eager for a happy ending that I ignored the fact that I didn't really know you.

We didn't take the time to build a strong foundation for our relationship.

We just dove right in and hoped for the best.

But love doesn't work that way.

You can't skip steps or take shortcuts.

If you don't establish a strong foundation, everything will crumble like a house of cardsâ€”especially when one person gives more than the other, like I did for you.

Before meeting you, I had a life full of things I loved.

But after meeting you, you became the most important thing to me.

I focused all my energy on making you happy, even putting aside my own desires.

I tried to follow your plans and ignore my own, hoping to please you.

However, whenever I suggested something for us to do, you dismissed it as silly.

I gave up many of my hobbies and time with friends just to avoid being alone.

I went overboard trying to make you happy - buying things you liked and making your favorite foods whenever you wanted.

At first, you did sweet things for me as well, but eventually you stopped.

I always went above and beyond to make sure you were taken care of.

I wanted you to show me the same care and attention I showed you.

I hoped you would ask about my day and be there for me when I needed you.

I wanted us to communicate openly and share our feelings equally.

I wanted us to work through our disagreements together.

But you continued to take without giving back, leaving me feeling unappreciated.

When I finally spoke up about my feelings, you dismissed them as too demanding and complained about my attempts to improve our relationship.

"You were correct, I felt bored.

I desired a man who would pay attention to me.

A man who would make me feel special and loved like you did at the beginning.

However, that man was no longer present.

I only had a man who took me for granted.

He ignored my existence in his life unless he needed something.

He didn't know how to love anyone but himself.

It seems like I loved too much.

I loved for the both of us and it had consequences.

I lost myself without realizing it.

I lost my self-confidence and forgot my own value.

I started prioritizing you in every aspect of my life.

I forgot who I was and what I wanted.

All my dreams and goals became a distant memory.

I don't blame you.

This was my mistake and I am going to fix it.

I am going to rebuild my life.

A life that I am proud of.

I am going to find that smile that I lost while I was with you.

I am going to make myself happy and I have already begun that journey by leaving you.
