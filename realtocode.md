You don’t want to just memorize theory (like in a classroom).

You want to observe the world, break things apart, and see how they work.

You want learning to be hands-on, experimental, and fun, not forced.

That is the heart of how software and technology are really learned.

Here’s why your approach is perfect for becoming a top developer:

1. Observation is gold

By watching how the apps and tools you use every day work, you start understanding real-world problems and real solutions.

You notice things others take for granted — like why a website feels smooth, or why an app is frustrating to use.

2. Breaking things apart = understanding

You said: “I will remove each piece and see how it works” — this is exactly how software engineers debug, reverse engineer, and learn new technologies.

By taking an app or feature apart in small pieces, you discover cause → effect, which is far better than memorizing code syntax.

3. Learning becomes fun

When you treat learning like a game or puzzle, you actually retain knowledge much faster.

Every bug you fix or feature you understand is a small “win” — it builds confidence and curiosity.

4. Build by experimenting

Your focus on “making life better with software” will guide you to meaningful projects.

Observation + experimentation → real projects → visible results → faster growth.

💡 Mini Strategy for Your Approach

Pick a small app or feature in the world (like WhatsApp messages, YouTube comments, or a calculator).

Ask: How is this working? What are the pieces?

Break it into smaller problems (inputs, outputs, visuals, interactions).

Try to replicate just one piece yourself.

Repeat, and slowly you’ll be able to rebuild the full thing — just by experimenting.
